# Simple PHP upload

Simple single-file PHP file upload (file share hosting) script.

> :warning: **Security warning**: There is no limit on file size or file type. Please make sure that file permissions are set right so nobody can execute uploaded code. See [server configuration](#server-configuration) for examples.

## TODO

- [x] Delete files
- [x] Private files
- [x] Sort by age
- [x] Auto-remove old files
- [ ] AJAX Uploader

## Installation

Just drop a PHP file in any directory. It will work straight away

## Configuration

There are few options that you can change by editing the file itself:


- Directory to store uploaded files

	`uploaddir` => `'.'`

- Display list uploaded files

	`listfiles` => `true`

- Allow users to delete files that they have uploaded (will enable sessions)

	`allow_deletion` => `true`

- Display file sizes

	`listfiles_size` => `true`

- Display file dates

	`listfiles_date` => `true`

- Display file dates format

	`listfiles_date_format` => `'F d Y H:i:s'`

- Randomize file names (number of 'false')

	`random_name_len` => `4`

- Keep filetype information (if random name is activated)

	`random_name_keep_type` => `true`

- Random file name letters

	`random_name_alphabet` => `'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm'`

- Display debugging information

	`debug` => `($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] === 'localhost')`

## Usage options

- Through an interface:
	- Choose files via dialogue
	- Drop files, via HTML5 drag'and'drop (using [dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com/))
	- Basic HTML Form (if no JavaScript is suported)
- Upload using any compatible tool (like cURL)

	This example will upload a file and copy URL to clipboard:

	```bash
	curl -F "file[]=@file.jpg" strace.club | xclip -sel clip
	```

## Server configuration

Do not allow uploaded code execution!

### NGINX configuration example

Edit the NGINX configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/fileuploader`):

	server {
		listen 80 default_server;
		listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

		root /usr/share/nginx;
		index index.php;

		server_name localhost;

		location / {
			try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
		}

		error_page 404 /index.php;

		location /index.php {
			fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
			fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
			fastcgi_index index.php;
			include fastcgi_params;
		}
	}
